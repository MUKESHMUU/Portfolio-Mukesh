        description: "TOR-Unveil is a cybersecurity-focused web application designed to analyze and monitor hidden services on the TOR network. Our team built this platform to detect potential malicious activities and provide structured intelligence insights. I worked on backend development, implementing APIs for data processing, TOR-based scraping logic, and secure data storage. The system processes collected data, applies filtering and keyword-based threat detection, and presents actionable insights through a structured dashboard. The project emphasizes anonymity handling, secure communication, and scalable backend architecture.",
